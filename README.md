# Meteor Shower Detector
DBSCAN algorithm for clustering is applied on the data which presents us the position where meteors have fallen. The dataset is publicly available by NASA. 
The application helps in finding out which regions on earth are more prone to meteor showers. 
Gmplot library is used for plotting the regions on world map. This makes data visualization more appealing.
